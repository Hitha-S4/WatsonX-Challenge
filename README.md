# Use Case Section
## Name of use case	: Project Planning and Task Assignment using Agentic AI
## Industry of use case	: Multi-Agent Collaboration in Enterprises (AI in Project Management)
## Description of use case:
	Our idea leverages AI agents to streamline project planning and task allocation. The system analyzes project requirements, team member expertise, workload, and availability to optimize task distribution and sprint planning. AI agents take charge of the workflow, identifying EPICs and stories, creating them in Jira with detailed descriptions, and assigning tasks to team members based on their skills and bandwidth. These agents also calculate and create sprints, split tasks into manageable goals, and define clear sprint objectives. Additionally, they enable optional dynamic recalibration to refine task estimates and adjust assignments as the project evolves. By automating these processes, AI agents eliminate inefficiencies, minimize manual effort, and ensure seamless alignment between project goals and team capacity. This innovative solution empowers teams to focus on creativity and execution, driving faster delivery, greater productivity, and project success.

## Challenges/hopes of each persona
### 	Persona A – Project Manager	
•	Challenges: Struggles to allocate tasks effectively due to limited visibility into team members' current workload. Spends significant time manually planning sprints, estimating tasks, and managing Jira updates. Coordination inefficiencies often result in delays and missed deadlines.

•	Hopes: A system that automates project planning, assigns tasks based on team strengths, and provides better resource utilization, freeing up time for higher-level strategic planning.

###	Persona B – Team Member	
•	Challenges: Often assigned tasks that don’t align with their expertise, leading to inefficiency and frustration. Experiences uneven workload distribution, causing burnout or idle time. Unclear sprint goals make it difficult to track progress.

•	Hopes: A tool that ensures fair task allocation based on their skills and bandwidth, with well-defined sprint goals and expectations, allowing them to focus on meaningful work without being overburdened.

As-is process (without Agentic AI)	
•	Project planning is manual and time-consuming, requiring the Project Manager to analyze project requirements and divide them into EPICs and stories.
•	EPICs and stories are created manually in Jira, with descriptions and details often incomplete or inconsistent.
•	Task allocation is done manually based on limited knowledge of team members' workloads.
•	Sprint planning is prone to errors, with uneven distribution of work across sprints and unclear sprint objectives.
•	Revisiting task estimates or reassigning tasks during the project lifecycle is cumbersome and leads to delays.
•	Team members face inefficiencies due to misaligned tasks, uneven workloads, and a lack of clarity on sprint goals.



 
## Solution Section
To-be process (with Agentic AI)
•	AI agents automatically analyze project requirements, breaking them into EPICs and stories.
•	EPICs and stories are created directly in Jira by the agents, with comprehensive descriptions and metadata added automatically.
•	AI agents allocate tasks to team members by assessing their skills, expertise, and availability, ensuring balanced workloads.
•	Sprint planning is automated, with AI agents defining sprint goals, calculating sprint durations, and distributing stories evenly across sprints.
•	Dynamic recalibration is enabled, allowing the system to revisit task estimates and assignments based on real-time updates.
•	Team members receive tasks tailored to their strengths and workload, with clear sprint objectives and timelines.

## Business value statement
•	Persona A – Project Manager	•	Gains significant time savings by automating repetitive project planning tasks.
•	Improves resource utilization and team productivity through optimized task allocation.
•	Reduces errors and inefficiencies in sprint planning, resulting in smoother project execution.
•	Enables better focus on strategic decision-making and higher-level planning.
•	
•	Persona B – Team Member	
•	Experiences fair and efficient task allocation that aligns with their skills and expertise.
•	Avoids burnout with balanced workload distribution.
•	Gains clarity on sprint goals, making it easier to track progress and achieve outcomes.
•	Feels more engaged and valued, contributing to overall team morale and productivity.
